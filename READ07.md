# Introduction Java script

## How Javascript makes web pages more interactive ?

- Access content
- Modify Content
- program rules 
- React To events 

## BROWSER SUPPORT

***Some early examples in this book do not work with Internet Explorer 8 and earlier (but alternative code samples that work in IE8 are available to download from http:// j avascri pt book. com) We explain techniques for dealing with older browsers in later chapters***

## The A B C for programing 

### A  What is a script 

- SCRIPT IS A SERI ES OF INSTRUCTIONS 

# EXPRESSIONS 

## ***An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions***

1- ***EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be given a value. As you have seen, this is done using the assignment operator (the equals sign). var color = 'beige';***

2- ***EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUEYou can perform operations on any number of individual values (see next page) toetermine a single value. For example: var area = 3 * 2;***

# OPERATORS 

## Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values

# ARITHMETIC OPERATORS 


## JavaScript contains the following mathematical operators, which you can use with numbers. You may remember some from math class.

# WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements)

### also there is a ways to declear a function and call a function in javascripts we will talk about it later :)
