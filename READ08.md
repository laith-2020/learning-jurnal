  # Comparison operators: evaluating Conditions

  ## USING COMPARISON OPERATORS  

  ### **At the most basic level, you can evaluate two variables using a comparison operator to return a t rue or f alse value.In this example, a user is taking a test, and the script tells the user whether they have passed this round of the test.The example starts by setting two variables: 1. pass to hold the pass mark 2. score to hold the users score**

  # Logical operators 

  ## Comparison operators usually return single calue of true or false .also logical operators allow you to compare the result of more than one comparison operator

  - && means and 
  - || means or 
  - ! means Not

  # Loops 

  ### the loops is check a condition , if the condition are true it will run a code inside the block , if not it will go out of it 

  ## THre Way to write a loop

  - For loop
  - While loop 
  - Do while loop

### USING FOR LOOPS :

#### A for loop is often used to loop through the items in an array.

### USING WHILE LOOPS: 

####  while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.

### USING DO WHILE LOOPS  :

#### The key difference between a whi 1 e loop and a do whi 1e  loop is that the statements in the code block come before the condition. This means that those statements are run once whether or not the condition is met.
