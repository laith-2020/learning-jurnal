# How Computer Work

- This first Think you should know what makes a Computer A computer 

- then how information is represented using electricity 

- also how computer use circut 

## The 4 Thing common to all computers 

1- Inpu
2- Storage
3- processing
4- output

## **Also Dont Forget the great thing is a computer work on A Zero & One (True and false)**

## Also We have a binary number system and decimal number system than all these it is related to how to make a text and photo and audio ..etc in computer

### The input devices of a computer can depend on the type of computer we are dealing with but most typically we will find a mouse, keyboard, scanner or even applications (software) installed on the computer. Once the data has been received, the central processing unit (CPU) along with the help of other components, takes over and processes the information it was given. Once the data is ready, it will be sent back through an output device which can be a monitor, speaker, printer, ports, etc.

## What's the difference between hardware and software?


### The beauty of a computer is that it can run a word-processing program one minute—and then a photo-editing program five seconds later. In other words, although we don't really think of it this way, the computer can be reprogrammed as many times as you like. This is why programs are also called software. They're "soft" in the sense that they are not fixed: they can be changed easily. By contrast, a computer's hardware—the bits and pieces from which it is made (and the peripherals, like the mouse and printer, you plug into it)—is pretty much fixed when you buy it off the shelf. The hardware is what makes your computer powerful; the ability to run different software is what makes it flexible. That computers can do so many different jobs is what makes them so useful—and that's why millions of us can no longer live without them!
